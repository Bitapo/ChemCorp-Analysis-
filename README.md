Chemcorp Incorporated is a leading producer of chemicals which has six primary industries and eleven chemicals products and recently lost 10 percent of its revenue due to losing long term customers.

In this analysis, we want to explore “How can ChemCorp prevent the loss of future market share through the identification of future growth industries and identification of at least one divestment product in at least one of their industries” by analyzing Market Opportunities, Customer Strategy and Product Divestment. 

Excel and Tableau were used to gather the insights and findings.
